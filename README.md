A watchface for Pebble.

Fiftyeight tells the time. It has won no awards for design, not is it stunning or premium.
What Fiftyeight does do is reimagine the WV-58 with dynamic glyphs
that change in width to emphasize the hour, an analog time constellation that updates each second,
and a compact representation of the week ahead.
