Fiftyeight tells the time, but it doesn't tell you what it should look like. Hate the analog clock? You can hide it. Figure the AM/PM indicator and date are useless? Replace them with a battery indicator and step counter. Fiftyeight lets you decide what matters most so that useful stuff is available at a glance.
